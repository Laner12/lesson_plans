## Setup Prior to Class

* Make sure you have an active account with Sendgrid. You can set it up through [their website](https://sendgrid.com/marketing/sendgrid-services) but some students have run into issues with that. An easy workaround is to set it up through [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sendgrid).

## You've Changed

Sometimes in life, people change. Like a frog boiled slowly in a pot of
water, they may not notice. It's our job as friends to let people know:
"You've Changed".

However in-person communication is sometimes a bit dicey. Let's build an
app that lets us do this electronically via email.

What we'd like our app to do:

1. Allow us to sign up / log in
2. Allow us to enter a friend's email address
3. Send that friend a passive-aggressive email notifying them that
   "You've changed".
