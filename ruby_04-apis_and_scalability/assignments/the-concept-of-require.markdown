## Deliverable

  - Read [Node.js, Require and Exports][rblog] and [Organize Your Code with RequireJS][rblog2]
  - Fork This Gist
  - Respond in your forked gist with answers to the following questions
    - In the context of Node, what is a `module`?
    
      * A module in Node from my understanding, is a function that wraps other functions and basically copies/mimics the functionality and imports it into another file in order to be used as intended.
    
    
    - The code examples from the second blog post look very different from the first. Why?
    
      * From my understanding of the article, the second is utilizing a work around for the module.exports syntax. It also seems that these examples are not just stand alone js constructor funcitons but files inside a framework similar to rails.
