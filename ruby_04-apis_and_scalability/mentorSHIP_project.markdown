# MentorSHIP: JavaScript Rebuild

## The Project

[MentorSHIP](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/mentorSHIP) was a Rails application built by one of the first cohorts at Turing to try and create a place for Mentors and Students to connect. The application has a ton of features and hasn't been updated since the project ended. It's a great idea, and everyone on staff wants it to be a thing.

We will be working to get started doing a full JavaScript rebuild.

The goals of the project are to:
- Push good code or document research spikes for future developers
- Cut scope on the existing project and work towards an MVP that Mary and the mentors can test out
- Gain experience working in a JavaScript application and compare it to an existing Rails application
- Get accustomed to agile workflow practices such as daily stand ups

### Pre-Work

You'll be expected to have reviewed the following materials by Monday.

- [Clone and Review the existing mentorSHIP applications, get them running locally](https://github.com/turingMentorSHIP)
- Review all documentation in the mentorSHIP organization
- Review all open issues

## Requirements

### Blog Posts

Since this project is being run like a consulting project, the emphasis is to get work done _well_. A big part of the project will be documenting our travels. One of the goals of this project is strengthen your portfolio and there is no better way to do that than to showcase your expertise in an area that not may other people know about. In addition to programming, you'll be writing a blog post on the features you choose to implement or research.

**Important Note**: It's easy to complain how stuff is hard in a blog post. Not only is that not particularly helpful to anyone who reads your post, it turns out that most open source software is created by humans and humans have a tendency to feel really bad when you complain about their donated efforts.

### Daily Stand Ups
Each story will have acceptance criteria which must be met. Inclusive in that criteria is attending and discussing where you are at with the team in a daily standup. We will hold our stand ups daily, before classes start in the afternoon, so come prepared to give examples and speak for at least 5 minutes about what you have accomplished.

### Pull Requests

You will be expected to work in a pull request process on your code and within your team. All major work should be pull requested in to your repo and you should expect to tag relevant mentors/students and drop PRs in slack. You will need at least one teammate to 'approve' your PR before you merge it.

You should expect to spend some time reviewing pull requests of others - a good metric is to select a PR a day to look over in depth from other teammates.

### Tracking hours

Students will be expected to track their hours in Harvest on a daily basis. Aim to complete 8 working hours per work day (times are flexible). Self study and classes that you attend count towards your 8 daily hours (as long as it is relevant to the work you're doing).
